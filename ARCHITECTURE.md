# Mac Cleaner - Architecture & Best Practices Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture
- **Layered Architecture**
  - `domain`: Business logic and entities
  - `application`: Use cases and application services
  - `infrastructure`: External services, repositories, and frameworks
  - `presentation`: UI and API interfaces

### 2. SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces over one general interface
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules

### 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests first (Red)
- Write minimum code to pass tests (Green)
- Refactor code while keeping tests passing (Refactor)
- Maintain 100% code coverage
- Use property-based testing for edge cases

### 4. Code Quality Standards
- Type hints everywhere (strict mypy checking)
- Docstrings for all public APIs
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 5
- Maximum method length of 20 lines
- Comprehensive error handling
- No global state

### 5. Security First
- Input validation at system boundaries
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure by default configurations
- Audit logging for all operations
- Dry-run mode for dangerous operations
- Undo capability for all operations

### 6. Modern UI/UX Principles
- Progressive disclosure
- Immediate feedback
- Undo/Redo support
- Consistent design language
- Accessibility compliance
- Responsive design

## Development Workflow
1. **Feature Development**
   - Create feature branch
   - Write tests first
   - Implement feature
   - Run all tests
   - Code review
   - Merge to main

2. **Quality Gates**
   - 100% test coverage
   - All tests passing
   - Type checking passing
   - Linting passing
   - Security checks passing
   - Performance benchmarks met

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Security scanning
   - Performance testing
   - Documentation generation

## Security Measures
- Secure coding practices
- Regular dependency updates
- Security testing
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- Privilege management

## Performance Considerations
- Async operations where appropriate
- Resource usage monitoring
- Performance testing
- Caching strategies
- Lazy loading
- Batch operations

## Documentation Requirements
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- User documentation
- Code documentation
- Change log
- Contributing guide

## Monitoring and Observability
- Structured logging
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Usage analytics
- Health checks
