# ADR 1: Clean Architecture Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Need a maintainable, testable, and scalable architecture for the Mac Cleaner project.

## Decision
Implement Clean Architecture with four main layers:
1. Domain (core business logic)
2. Application (use cases)
3. Infrastructure (external services)
4. Presentation (user interfaces)

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable components
- Maintainable codebase
- Framework independence

### Negative
- More initial setup
- More boilerplate code
- Steeper learning curve

## Implementation
See architecture/README.md for detailed implementation guidelines.
